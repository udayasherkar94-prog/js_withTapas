JavaScript Script Loading (Simple Notes)
1. Inline Script
JavaScript written inside HTML
✅ Good for small code
❌ Bad for big projects (hard to manage)

2. External Script (Normal <script>)
Browser reads HTML top to bottom
When it finds <script>:
HTML stops
Script downloads and runs
Then HTML continues
❌ Can slow page
❌ DOM may not be ready

3. async
Script downloads while HTML loads
Runs as soon as it’s ready
Order not fixed
❌ DOM may not be ready
✅ Best for ads, analytics, chatbots

4. defer ⭐ (Most Important)
Script downloads while HTML loads
Runs after HTML is fully loaded
DOM is ready
Scripts run in order
✅ Best for most websites

5. Best Practice
Use defer for normal JavaScript
Use async for third-party scripts
JavaScript Outside Browser (Node.js)
JavaScript can run on server
Tool used: Node.js
Run file using: node file.js


🔑 One-Line Summary

defer = safe + fast + recommended
async = fast but risky
normal script = slow
Node.js = JS outside browser
